You can run and experiment with the code in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your own computer*.\n","\n","#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n","\n","The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\".\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Add Conda binaries to your system `PATH`, so you can use the `conda` command on your terminal.\n","\n","2. Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n","\n","```\n","conda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8 \n","conda activate zerotopandas\n","pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n","```\n","\n","3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook. The command will look something like this:\n","\n","```\n","jovian clone notebook-owner/notebook-id\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","4. Enter the newly created directory using `cd directory-name` and start the Jupyter notebook.\n","\n","```\n","jupyter notebook\n","```\n","\n","You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook file (it has a `.ipynb` extension) to open it.\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Downloading the Dataset\n","\n","We utilize the power of the OpenDatasets library to download the dataset from Kaggle.
